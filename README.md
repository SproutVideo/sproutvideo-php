# SproutVideo
Use this library to interact with the [SproutVideo API](http://sproutvideo.com/docs/api.html)

# Installation
## Install with Composer
If you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies, you can add SproutVideo with.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "sproutvideo/sproutvideo": "1.3.1"
  }
}
```
Composer will take care of the autoloading for you, so if you require the vendor/autoload.php, you're good to go.

## Install source from GitHub
To install the source code:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sproutvideo/sproutvideo-php.git

And including it using the autoloader:
```php
<?php
require_once '/path/to/sproutvideo-php/lib/SproutVideo/Autoloader.php';
SproutVideo_Autoloader::register();
?>
```

# Getting Started
The first thing you'll need to interact with the SproutVideo API is your API key.
```php
<?php
SproutVideo::$api_key = 'abcd1234';
?>
```

# Videos
The following methods are available: `list_videos`, `get_video`, `create_video`, `update_video`, `replace_video`, `delete_video`.

## list_videos
By default the videos listing is paginated with 25 videos per page and sorted by upload date in ascending order. You can pass two parameters to control the paging: page and per_page. You can also pass in the id of a tag to just return the videos tagged with that tag.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::list_videos();
SproutVideo\Video::list_videos(array('per_page' => 10));
SproutVideo\Video::list_videos(array('per_page' => 10, 'page' => 2));
SproutVideo\Video::list_videos(array('tag_id' => 'abc')));
?>
```

## get_video
The string passed to get_video is the ID of a SproutVideo video.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::get_video('abc123');
?>
```

## create_video
The most basic upload you can perform is to just pass the path to the video file to the method. The title of the video will default to the name of the file.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::create_video('/path/to/video.mp4');
?>
```

You can set the title as well as many other parameters by passing them as a array

 ```php
 <?php
 SproutVideo\Video::create_video('/path/to/video.mp4', array('title' => 'My Awesome Video', 'description' => 'This video is great', 'privacy' => 2));
 ?>
```

You can also apply any number of tags to the new upload by passing their ids along:

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::create_video('/path/to/video.mp4', array('tags' => array('ec61', 'abc123'));
?>
```

You can also create and apply tags on the fly when uploading by passing along tag names:

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::create_video('/path/to/video.mp4', array('tag_names' => array('Tag One', 'Tag Two'));
?>
```



You can also specify a webhook url. We'll send an HTTP POST with the video json when the video has finished processing or if there was an error during processing:

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::create_video('/path/to/video.mp4', array('notification_url' => 'http://example.com/webhook_url'));
?>
```

## update_video
 The first parameter is the id of the video you wish to edit. The second parameter is a array of attributes to update on the video.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::update_video('abc123', array('title' => 'Updated Title'));
?>
```

## replace_video
The first parameter is the id of the video you wish to replace. The second parameter is the local path to the video file.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::replace_video('abc123', '/path/to/video.mp4');
?>
```


## Tags
To add a tag to a video, make sure to include all of the tags currently associated with the video. For instance, if the video already has tags with the ids "abc" and "123", and you want to add a tag with the id "def", pass "abc", "123" and "def" to the update method.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::update_video('abc123', 'tags' => array("abc", "123", "def"));
?>
```

If you want to remove a tag from a video, remove the tag from the list of tags on the video but make sure to include all of the tags you wish to keep. For instance, if you now want to remove the tag with id "123" from the example above, pass in "abc" and "def"

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::update_video("abc123", array('tags' => array("abc","def"));
?>
```

You can remove all of the tags from a video by just passing an empty array as the tags parameter.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::update_video('abc123', array('tags' => array()));
?>
```

## Upload poster frame
You can upload a custom poster frame for a video by calling the upload_poster_frame method. The first parameter is the id of the video for wish you'd like the poster frame to be associated and the second parameter is the path to the image file.
```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::upload_poster_frame('abc123','/path/to/video.mp4');
?>
```


## delete_video
Pass in the id of the video you wish to delete.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::delete_video('abc123');
?>
```

## Signed Embed Codes
You can use this convenience method to sign an embed code. It will return the embed code URL which can be used to build an iframe embed code.

```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::signed_embed_code($video_id, $security_token, $query_parameters, $expiration_time, $protocol);
?>
```

### Parameters
video_id - *String* ( *Required* )
: The id of the video for which you're generating the signed embed code

security_token - *String* ( *Required* )

query_parameteres - *Array* ( *Optional* )
: A array of query parameters to be passed to the embed code. Example: `array('type' => 'hd', 'autoplay' => 'true')`

expiration_time - *Integer* ( *Optional* )
: The number of seconds from the Epoc that this signed embed code should expire. This defaults to 5 minutes from the time the signed embed code was generated.

protocol - *String* ( *Optional* )

### Examples
```php
<?php
SproutVideo\Video::signed_embed_code('abc123','def456'); #sign a base embed code with no other options
SproutVideo\Video::signed_embed_code('abc123','def456', array('type' => 'hd')); #set parameters for the embed code such as changing the default video type to HD
SproutVideo\Video::signed_embed_code('abc123','def456', array(), 1368127991); #set a specific expiration time for the signed embed code. (By default the expiration time is set to 5 minutes from the time the signed embed code was generated).

# Analytics
The following methods are available through the API client for analytics:

* play_counts
* domains
* geo
* video_types
* playback types
